# StrongSORT-Object-Tracking
This repository implements StrongSORT which is an upgraded version of DeepSORT, with YOLOv5 detections, which is fine tuned on custom dataset, to track cars in a parking lot. It has an additional security feature implemented which activates an alert as soon as a car moves from its position.
